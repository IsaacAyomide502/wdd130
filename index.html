        <p>Hello! I am Isaac Ayomide, a curious and hardworking student who loves learning new things and finding better
            ways to solve
            problems. I have a strong interest in data analysis, production planning, and inventory management because I
            enjoy
            working with numbers and making sense of data to improve processes. I am always eager to grow, both
            academically and
            personally, and I take pride in staying consistent and disciplined in everything I do. I enjoy collaborating
            with
            others, sharing ideas, and learning from different perspectives. My goal is to keep building my skills and
            use them to
            make a positive impact wherever I find myself.</p>

        <h2>Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria</h2>
        <img src="images/abeokuta.jpg" alt="New Railway Station">
        <p>Abeokuta is connected to nearby Lagos by a railway that was completed in 1899, with a length of 77 kilometres
            (48 mi).
            In 2013, the Abeokuta flyover was constructed. Since 2021 there is a standard gauge railway line
            Lagos-Ibadan, which
            stops at Abeokuta.[10] For this a new railway building has been built in Abeokuta. Tickets are bought by
            online booking
            only.</p>
